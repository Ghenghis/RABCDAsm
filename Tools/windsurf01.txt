Special markers and keys
Resource-specific validation
Pattern-based verification
Would you like me to make any additional improvements or focus on a specific area?

Pattern Detection Enhancement


While Tag 233 and 396 are now working, the pattern detection could be made more robust
The entropy checks (4.27 and 5.55) suggest room for fine-tuning
Consider adding more test cases with edge-case patterns


ABC Tag Optimization


The special marker (0xBF14) support is working, but you might want to:

Add performance optimizations for key derivation
Expand test coverage for different string pool scenarios
Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed pool offsets




Further Validation Areas


Consider adding validation for:

Edge cases in resource handling
Corrupted or malformed input data
Boundary conditions in encryption layers

I'll enhance the validation framework with these improvements. Let me start with the pattern detection and test cases:
